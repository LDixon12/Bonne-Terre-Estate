// Required properties
"title": "Bonne Terre Estate", // Give your project a good title
"info": "My family acquired this property in 2019 and got the license to turn it into an event space. We have only hosted one wedding thus far (thanks 2020). Though I live in Lexington, KY, Columbia, MO is still my home so I like to help out with the new family business when I can. My family has requested that I find features within 10 miles of the property with a main focus on hotels, restaurants/cafes/bars and 2 airports. This is so we can give our customers suggestions of places to stay and eat while also showing them we are a convenient location for out of town guests.", // A short blurb about your project
